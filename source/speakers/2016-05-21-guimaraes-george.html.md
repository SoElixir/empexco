It's inevitable: you'll need to do some tasks in background. Maybe it's an email you need to send. Maybe it's an image resizing. Maybe it's a business rule that doesn't need to run in the web request.

In this talk, we'll code and test implementations for these patterns in Elixir/Phoenix, ranging from how you can use `Task.async` or `Task.Supervisor` for fire-and-forget tasks, to using an "external" queue and workers like `exq`. 

More importantly than the tools, we'll examine the kinds of questions you need to ask to decide which tool will fit your needs.
