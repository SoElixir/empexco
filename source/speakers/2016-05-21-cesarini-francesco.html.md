Erlang/OTP has for years been described as your secret sauce to writing scalable and available systems. Erlang alone, however, will not do any magic. It is merely an enabler that, thanks to its semantics, programming model and predictable virtual machine makes the end results easier to achieve.

In this talk, we will walk through the topology patterns of modern distributed architectures, discussing the tradeoffs in scalability and reliability of the actor model, the failure model and the built-in distribution model the BEAM encourages you to take.
