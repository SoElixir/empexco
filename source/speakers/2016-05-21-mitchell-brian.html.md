It's often hard to understand what actually happens when we run our code. There are many layers like macros, AST to AST translations, intermediate languages, instruction codes, virtual machine models, and finally interpreters and compilers.

This talk will show how Elixir and Erlang code travels through all of these stages and ends up getting executed. We'll demystify the runtime and learn about tools that can help when optimizing and checking assumptions you might make in your code.
