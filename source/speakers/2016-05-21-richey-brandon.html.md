Elixir allowed us to deploy an incredibly high-throughput, low footprint Phoenix API with no issues from the second it entered production. With no prior Erlang/Elixir experience, just ambition (and education!), and our team nervously jumped into the platform and we couldn't be more excited by the results.

Together, we'll highlight Teladoc's journey of taking Elixir into Production. From the initial conversations, the highs and lows, and our excitement going forward, you'll hear a success story from the trenches:

- How we started initial conversations about adopting Elixir
- Research into the platform
- The educational initiatives to convince the development team
- The education process for management
- The resulting application and benchmarks
- Issues we ran into along the way
- What the future holds for our company for Elixir/Phoenix (Hint: we have more projects on the way based on the success of our first)"
