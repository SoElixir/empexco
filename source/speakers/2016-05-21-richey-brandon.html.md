Elixir allowed us to deploy an incredibly high-throughput, low-footprint Phoenix API that experience no issues from the second it entered production. With no prior Erlang/Elixir experience, our team jumped in and we couldn't be more excited by the results.

Together, we'll highlight Teladoc's journey of taking Elixir into Production. From the initial conversations, the highs and lows, and our excitement going forward, you'll hear a success story from the trenches covering:

- Initial conversations about adopting Elixir
- Research into the platform
- Education initiatives to convince the development team
- Persuading management
- The resulting application and benchmarks
- Issues we ran into along the way
- What the future holds for our company and Elixir/Phoenix (Hint: more projects!)
